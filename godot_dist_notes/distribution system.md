- assumes:
	- [ ] templates in ~/Godot/GodotX/Godot_vX.Y.Z/templates
	- [ ] a file named export_info.json in the root of the project
- [ ] a dist folder in ~/Godot/dist
- [ ] a export script that, given the path to a project,
	- [ ] clones the last commit to dist/temp/project_name/source
		- is there a way to only copy the last commit tagged a certain way?
		- git clone -b TAG_NAME only moves the head
	- [ ] writes to export_info.json
		- [ ] the version (the commit hash) 
		- [ ] the daytime
	- [ ] exports the game to ~Godot/dist/project_name/output, where there are folders windows and linux containg each demo and full
	- [ ] deletes temp/project_name/source
- [ ] a publish script that, given the path to a project,
	- [ ] runs the export script
	- [ ] takes what is in the dist subfolders and uploads it to steam
	- [ ] deletes everything in temp/project_name
	- [ ] logs the upload in the root of the project directory
